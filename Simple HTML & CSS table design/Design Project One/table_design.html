              Tether is a cryptocurrency. In fact, it's the world’s
              third-biggest digital coin by market value. But it’s very
              different from bitcoin and other virtual currencies. Tether is
              what’s known as a stablecoin. These are digital currencies that
              are tied to real-world assets — the U.S. dollar, for example — to
              maintain a stable value, unlike most cryptocurrencies which are
              known to be volatile. Bitcoin, for example, rose to an all-time
              high of nearly $65,000 in April and has since almost halved in
              value.Tether was designed to be pegged to the dollar. While other
              cryptocurrencies often fluctuate in value, tether’s price is
              usually equivalent to $1. This isn’t always the case though, and
              wobbles in the value of tether have spooked investors in the past.
              Crypto traders often use tether to buy cryptocurrencies, as an
              alternative to the greenback. This essentially provides them with
              a way to seek safety in a more stable asset during times of sharp
              volatility in the crypto market. However, crypto isn’t regulated,
              and many banks avoid doing business with digital currency
              exchanges due to the level of risk involved. That’s where
              stablecoins tend to come in.

              EOS.IO is software that introduces a blockchain architecture
              designed to enable vertical and horizontal scaling of
              decentralized applications (the “EOS.IO Software”). This is
              achieved through an operating system-like construct upon which
              applications can be built. The software provides accounts,
              authentication, databases, asynchronous communication and the
              scheduling of applications across multiple CPU cores anor
              clusters. The resulting technology is a blockchain architecture
              that has the potential to scale to millions of transactions per
              second, eliminates user fees and allows for quick and easy
              deployment of decentralized applications. For more information,
              please read the EOS.IO Technical White Paper. In the case of EOS,
              circulating supply and total supply are available but max supply
              is not available, which indicates that EOS supply is infinite. The
              current cap is 1 billion tokens, there will be an inflation of up
              to 5% per annum to reward the block producers and they may use
              these to sell or to invest back into EOS dapps. Blockchain data

              Litecoin’s strongest year in recent history, was 2019 during its
              halving. The cryptocurrency known as the silver to Bitcoin’s as
              digital gold rose 600% that year, before crashing back down to
              retest its bear market bottom. 2020 was a brutal year with very
              little action, causing investors interested in LTC to ask the
              questions “will Litecoin go up in value,” “how high will Litecoin
              go,” and “will Litecoin ever reach 1000 dollars per LTC.” Already
              in 2021, Litecoin has set its first higher high since its all-time
              high price record was set in 2017. A higher-high after a higher
              low is the definition of an uptrend. Since the peak was put in
              during the beginning of 2021, Litecoin began to pullback but
              appears to be retesting former resistance turned support. If
              support can hold the cryptocurrency will confirm a new bull market
              is here and could see a move similar to what Bitcoin has done in
              recent months.
