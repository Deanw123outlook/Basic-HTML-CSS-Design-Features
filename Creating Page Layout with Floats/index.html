            modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more
            explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent
            variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple
            linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple
            linear regression. This term is distinct from multivariate linear
            regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are
            predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.In linear
            regression, the relationships are modeled using linear predictor
            functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the
            data. Such models are called linear models. Most commonly, the
            conditional mean of the response given the values of the explanatory
            variables (or predictors) is assumed to be an affine function of
            those values; less commonly, the conditional median or some other
            quantile is used. Like all forms of regression analysis, linear
            regression focuses on the conditional probability distribution of
            the response given the values of the predictors, rather than on the
            joint probability distribution of all of these variables, which is
            the domain of multivariate analysis.

            text content of this web-page! Logistic regression is a statistical
            model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a
            binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions
            exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit
            regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form
            of binary regression). Mathematically, a binary logistic model has a
            dependent variable with two possible values, such as pass/fail which
            is represented by an indicator variable, where the two values are
            labeled "0" and "1".
